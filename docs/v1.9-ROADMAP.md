# v1.9 Roadmap: Onboarding Optimization

**Theme**: Zero to Productive in 10 Minutes

**Release Target**: TBD

---

## Overview

Version 1.9 focuses exclusively on improving the onboarding experience for new Flywheel users. No new features—just making it easier to get started.

**Goals**:
- Reduce time-to-first-value from 30 minutes to 10 minutes
- Eliminate common setup pain points
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Create guided onboarding experience

---

## P1 Issues (Must Have)

### 1. TROUBLESHOOTING.md Documentation

**Issue**: Users get stuck with common problems (MCP connection, missing files, hook failures)

**Solution**: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

**Contents**:
- Common errors and fixes
- Platform-specific issues (Windows vs WSL)
- MCP connection debugging
- Hook failure recovery
- Gate denial explanations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Covers top 10 user-reported issues
- [ ] Platform-specific sections (Windows/WSL/macOS)
- [ ] Clear fix steps for each error
- [ ] Screenshots/examples where helpful

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

---

### 2. FIRST_10_MINUTES.md Tutorial

**Issue**: Users don't know what to do after installation

**Solution**: Step-by-step guided tutorial with copy-paste commands

**Contents**:
1. Verify installation (health check)
2. Run first command (`/vault-health`)
3. Create first daily note
4. Add first log entry (`/auto-log`)
5. See first achievement
6. Run first rollup (if enough data)
7. Explore next steps

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 10-minute completion time (timed with real users)
- [ ] All commands copy-paste ready
- [ ] Success indicators at each step
- [ ] Links to next learning resources

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

---

### 3. Enhanced `/onboard` Skill (Interactive Wizard)

**Issue**: Current `/onboard` just shows stats, doesn't guide setup

**Solution**: Interactive wizard that detects and configures vault

**Flow**:
```
1. Detect vault type:
   - Personal (daily notes, habits, food tracking)
   - Team (standups, meetings, projects)
   - Research (experiments, papers, logs)
   - Custom (user chooses)

2. Scan existing notes:
   - Find daily notes folder (if exists)
   - Detect existing note patterns
   - Identify vault conventions

3. Generate `.flywheel.json`:
   - Suggest paths based on scan
   - Offer customization options
   - Show preview before creating

4. Create missing folders:
   - Ask to create daily-notes/ if missing
   - Offer to create templates/
   - Set up folder structure

5. Suggest first commands:
   - "Try: /vault-health to see vault status"
   - "Try: /auto-log to add your first entry"
   - "Try: /rebuild-cache to index your notes"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Detects vault type with 80% accuracy
- [ ] Generates valid `.flywheel.json`
- [ ] Creates missing folders on confirmation
- [ ] Provides 3 suggested next commands
- [ ] Completes in < 2 minutes

**Estimated Effort**: High

---

### 4. Actionable Error Messages

**Issue**: Errors like "Connection closed" don't tell users how to fix

**Solution**: Transform cryptic errors into actionable guidance

**Examples**:

**Before**:
```
Error: Connection closed
```

**After**:
```
❌ MCP Connection Failed: "Connection closed"

This usually means the MCP server isn't configured correctly.

Fix for Windows:
  1. Open .mcp.json in your vault root
  2. Ensure command wraps npx with cmd /c:
     {
       "command": "cmd",
       "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@bencassie/flywheel-mcp"]
     }
  3. Restart Claude Code

Fix for WSL:
  1. Verify Python installed: python --version
  2. If fails, run: sudo apt install python-is-python3
  3. Restart Claude Code

Need help? See docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#mcp-connection
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All P1 errors have actionable messages
- [ ] Platform-specific fixes provided
- [ ] Link to relevant documentation
- [ ] Tested on Windows/WSL

**Error Coverage**:
- MCP connection failures
- File not found (suggest creating or fixing path)
- Hook failures (check Python installation)
- Gate denials (explain what to do next)
- Missing template (show path to create)

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

---

### 5. `.flywheel.json` Generator

**Issue**: Writing JSON config by hand is error-prone

**Solution**: Interactive config generator command

**Command**: `/generate-config`

**Flow**:
```
1. Scan vault:
   - Find existing folders
   - Detect note patterns (YYYY-MM-DD.md = daily notes)
   - Count notes per folder

2. Suggest config:
   "I found:
   - 42 notes in daily/ matching YYYY-MM-DD pattern
   - 8 notes in weekly/ matching YYYY-WXX pattern
   - 3 folders: templates/, projects/, meetings/

   Suggested config:
   {
     "paths": {
       "daily_notes": "daily",
       "weekly_notes": "weekly",
       "templates": "templates"
     }
   }"

3. Customize:
   - Ask about sections (Log, Food, Tasks, Habits)
   - Ask about habits to track
   - Ask about folder protection

4. Write config:
   - Show full .flywheel.json preview
   - Ask confirmation
   - Write to vault root
   - Validate with health check
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scans vault and suggests accurate config
- [ ] Allows customization of all fields
- [ ] Validates generated config
- [ ] Runs health check after creation
- [ ] Completes in < 3 minutes

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

---

## P2 Issues (Nice to Have)

### 6. FAQ.md Documentation

**Issue**: Common questions scattered across docs

**Solution**: Consolidated FAQ with top 20 questions

**Sample Questions**:
- How do I configure Flywheel for my vault?
- What's the difference between MCP and plugin?
- Why do I need to Read before Edit?
- How do I fix broken wikilinks?
- What's an ISO week?
- Can I use Flywheel with existing notes?
- How do I customize templates?
- What happens if daily notes are missing?
- How often does the cache rebuild?
- Can I use Flywheel in multiple vaults?

**Estimated Effort**: Low

---

### 7. Config Validation

**Issue**: Invalid config causes cryptic errors later

**Solution**: Validate `.flywheel.json` on load and provide clear errors

**Checks**:
- [ ] Required fields present (daily_notes)
- [ ] Paths exist or warn
- [ ] Section headings valid (have # or ##)
- [ ] No typos in field names
- [ ] JSON is valid

**Error Example**:

**Before**:
```
Error: Cannot read daily notes
```

**After**:
```
❌ Config Error in .flywheel.json

Field: paths.daily_notes
Value: "daly-notes"
Issue: Folder does not exist

Did you mean: "daily-notes"?

Fix:
  1. Open .flywheel.json
  2. Change "daly-notes" to "daily-notes"
  3. Or create the folder: daly-notes/
```

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

---

### 8. Gate Denial Explanations

**Issue**: Gate blocks operation but doesn't explain next steps

**Solution**: Every gate denial includes "What to do next"

**Example**:

**Before**:
```
Decision: DENY
Reason: Must Read file before editing
```

**After**:
```
❌ Gate 1 Blocked: Read Before Write

Cannot edit "daily-notes/2026-01-03.md" - file hasn't been read yet.

What to do:
  1. Read the file first:
     Read("daily-notes/2026-01-03.md")
  2. Then try your edit again

Why: This protects you from editing files blindly. Reading first
ensures you see the current content before making changes.

Learn more: docs/SIX_GATES.md#gate-1
```

**Estimated Effort**: Low

## Success Metrics

How do we know v1.9 succeeded?

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Time to first value | 30 min | 10 min |
| Setup success rate | 60% | 95% |
| MCP connection errors | 40% | <5% |
| "How do I...?" questions | 10/week | <2/week |
| User drops during setup | 50% | <10% |

---

## Out of Scope (Not v1.9)

These are good ideas but NOT in v1.9:

- ❌ Performance improvements (MCP caching, faster indexing)
- ❌ New skills or agents
- ❌ New MCP tools
- ❌ UI/web interface
- ❌ Cloud sync or sharing
- ❌ Mobile support
- ❌ Integrations with other tools

**Why not?** v1.9 is laser-focused on onboarding. New features can wait for v2.0.

## Future Considerations (v2.0+)

Ideas parking lot (not v1.9):

- Auto-detect periodic note conventions (zero config)
- MCP response caching for speed
- Faster index rebuilds (incremental)
- Demo vault selector (`flywheel init --demo artemis-rocket`)
- Interactive CLI tool (`flywheel` command with TUI)
- Health check auto-fix (not just warn)
- Migration tool for version upgrades
- Performance profiling dashboard

---
