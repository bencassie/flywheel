**You are**: A PhD student in computational biology

**Your situation**: You're studying protein folding and drug-target prediction. Your notes include 7 foundational papers, 6 methods, 10 experiments, and 2 active projects. You need to trace how ideas flow from literature through your work.

## Try it now

Ask Claude:

- "How does AlphaFold connect to my docking experiment?"
- "What did I work on last week?"
- "Which experiments share the same methods?"
- "Summarize my November research"
- "What papers haven't I built on yet?"

## What you'll discover

- Trace citation chains from papers through methods to your experiments
- Find which experiments build on each other
- See patterns in your research you didn't notice

## Mutations

When you ask Claude to make changes, here's what happens:

### Log experiment results

```
You: "/log docking run 7 complete - 0.3Å RMSD"

→ Modifies: daily-notes/2026-01-04.md

## Log
- 09:00 Literature review
- 15:22 docking run 7 complete - 0.3Å RMSD   ← ADDED
```

### Link a paper to your method

```
You: "connect AlphaFold paper to my folding method"

→ Modifies: methods/protein-folding.md

## References
- [[AlphaFold 2]]   ← ADDED
```
