## Try it now

Ask Claude:

- "How does AlphaFold connect to my docking experiment?"
- "What did I work on last week?"
- "Which experiments share the same methods?"
- "Summarize my November research"
- "What papers haven't I built on yet?"

## What you'll discover

- Trace citation chains from papers through methods to your experiments
- Find which experiments build on each other
- See patterns in your research you didn't notice
