# Startup Ops

> Let AI handle operations while you focus on building the product.

---

**You are**: Co-founder of MetricFlow, a B2B SaaS analytics startup

**Your situation**: Pre-Series A with 3 customers and 2 co-founders doing everything. You need to run ops (onboarding, support, metrics, investor updates) without hiring yet. You've got playbooks, customer records, and decisions scattered across 30 notes.

## Try it now

Ask Claude:

- "Walk me through onboarding a new customer"
- "What's our current MRR?"
- "What decisions need my review this week?"
- "Show me the support escalation process"
- "Summarize what happened with DataDriven Co"

## What you'll discover

- Run operational playbooks step-by-step with AI guidance
- Keep customer, product, and finance information connected
- Separate routine ops from strategic decisions that need your brain
